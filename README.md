The advantages of frontend workflows and tools
==============================================

A common scenario...

_You're working on a project with other developers and you need to add some functionality. You download the script, place it somewhere in the project folder, embed it on the page along with all the other existing scripts and move on. Later, another developer comes along needing similar functionality for a different page. They download the most up to date version of the same script, place it in a different folder, embed it on their page and move on._

There's a problem here, aside from the lack of communication. There's no clear or established workflow. There's no process outlined telling developers what to do. In response to this a number of frontend tools have emerged. They help us to answer the following questions:

**What libraries and scripts are being used in this project, what versions are we using and how do we update them or add new ones?**

**What is the process for embedding new things in our pages and how can we automate the tasks needed to do so?**

We will cover the following tools and set up a consistent workflow for dealing with these common issues. Future developers will thank you and your future self will thank you, because sometimes coming back to a project after a few months isn't as easy as it seems.

1. The universal tool: the command line
- A common language for frontend tools: [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
- Managing libraries with [Bower](http://bower.io/)
- Automating tasks with [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/)
